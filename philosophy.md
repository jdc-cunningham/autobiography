If you imagine yourself zooming out of the Earth and into space... everything that is your reality is gone.

Which yeah... this is not a ground breaking idea, pale blue dot, etc...

I feel that nothing I think about is novel... that idea of your thoughts are from your surroundings.

I kinda lost the drive to write this bit, after I screwed up this repo, also not anonymous so I can't really freely write.

I remember one of the places I spent a lot of my time when I was younger is in a workshop at the back of my US mother's house.

Her house had this large warehouse/workshop thing attached to it from previous owner. It benefitted me since I had a spot back there to build planes.

But I also had a second hand desktop and monitor that I put Linux Mint on.

I'd watch shows and movies in the background on that thing.

Anyway one of the movies I eventually come across is 2001 space odyssey.

I remember one particular scene, the Blue Danube... I always return to that scene every now and then.

Where the "thrown bone" becomes a spacecraft. And then the music hits, and you see space ships going past/orbitting planets.

That's like the pinnacle/what could be of human life.

While I did fail out of physics/school, I did grasp the scale of the universe (lol).

When you understand the speed of light, and how units in space are measured with that speed and years of it... years of constant light speed.

You realize how massive it all is, how we're trapped. You can counter argue, who cares, what's out there, nihilism... why try, etc...

Again pointless circling of the mind

Of course thankfully we're often too oblivious, sucked into our own daily things...

Which you know that's fine, everyone has their aspirations, goals...

It's like I don't know if meditation is a thing but if you stop, stop, stop... think... be in the moment.

You breathe, you realize you're this organism, this living being, blood pumping through you, exchanging atmosphere...

It's crazy sometimes I remember

Time is the constant it ticks down

Other truths, hunger, pain, isolation, etc...

Anyway it's just crazy... you can almost go insane if you stop and think about life

We are the beings capable of stepping out of "the system" the food chain, etc... seeing beyond our environment

I do miss seeing the stars... something about it is grounding

But yeah... back to the grind... don't worry I'm of sane mind as I write this.

Just finished a book, got the next one in series... got on that subscription yo (makes sense with the cost of some books I buy)

Continuing on with pursuit of knowledge and personal advancement

Anyway... that's a piece of me, I'll write another

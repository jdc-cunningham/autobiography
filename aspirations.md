Let me start by saying that I am pretty aware of my level of competence.

And it is not a lot... I am a mediocre developer, non-heavy algo type...

I can build things and I am not really a leader, I'm a low-self esteem type person so I don't believe in my choices.

There's also facts, experience, etc...

Anyway me saying I want to do this is hilarious... if scientists/dedicated people in this space can't figure it out, who are you?

So... that's why I'm learning random stuff

FPGA... why, the ability to create hardware "at will" with software

Hot loading of code... that's what an operating system is

Boy you can't even tokenize words

The why...

Loneliness is one reason, a companion, I think of the Venom movie

This voice in your head, that helps you, perhaps children in the future would be born with their own AI symbiote that grows with them

There's also the mortality aspect... somewhat of a tangent, another piece of tech I'm interested in eg. mind transfer

Beyond our time, lots of media about it

But yeah I want to learn these fields, AR rendering, mesh, 3D orientation, navigation, etc...

It will all culminate into something

Alright I'm done, time to sleep

(I did write this stuff before sleeping, had to fix the repo)

Adding on, underwater exploration drones, something about that speaks to me, hardware is more tangible to me

personal compute (yes I'm a cyberpunk 2077 fan)

constantly connected to something, mostly to log your thoughts which everyone has it, mobile phones

idk... if the mojo stuff and neuralink happens that would be interesting but being taken over would be a concern

same for home robots with AI that can be taken over... (~~SecUnit ha~~ this is not right, more like Ex Machina)

Anyway that's it, moving on

I also acknowledge ego satisfaction, do things before you write about them otherwise it's fluff so I broke that rule here

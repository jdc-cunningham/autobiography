I graduated a year early in high school, had the option to and I did it.

In the process I did not have a senior year and left my friends behind in high school.

We still hung out though but I think that was the start of our distancing. Also later on they went to a different school that was farther away.

At this time I was in the rugby club (Black horse) I was not good. I mostly joined to make new friends. I was a second eight man and pretty much never played just because I was bad. That was my own fault too I didn't try, I went to practices but yeah.

Partied a lot with these guys. At the time I was renting this like cupboard for $100/mo, I found this random couch/bed thing that was heavy as hell.

Lugged it up the stairs and into that room. Got a TV and PS3 in there.

I was working 3 jobs, part time dish washer, delivering pizza and something else, ~~I think the tech support job~~ no I was briefly a cook at Denny's but got fired because I was bad.

I was studying phys/eng at this point. I did well initially because I did the work/followed through. My calc classes for example I was at least a B student.

Later on I just started to fail, like get C's and D's. I took diff eq twice and I kept failing them because I would not study then cram last minute, that would result in like a C-.

I was still flying RC planes at this point, FPV too but I always had crappy parts, mostly because I would crash often and break them/not take care of them.

I remember running out of money on my points ha for buying food.

Yeah these were fun and also mad cringe times on my part.
